# AWS--The-Power-of
AWS Project- Building an End-to-End AWS Web Application
what did we do in this project:

1.	Webpage Creation and Hosting: Leveraged AWS Amplify to craft and host an intuitive webpage, facilitating mathematical calculations.
2.	Serverless Computation: Implemented Lambda functions to perform serverless mathematical calculations triggered upon user inputs.
3.	API Gateway Integration: Orchestrated API Gateway to securely invoke mathematical functionalities.
4.	DynamoDB Integration: Utilized DynamoDB to persistently store and retrieve mathematical results, enhancing data persistence.
5.	IAM Permissions: Configured IAM roles, granting Lambda functions the necessary permissions to interact with DynamoDB.
Technologies and Tools Used:
•	AWS Services: Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, IAM
•	Front-end Frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	Integration and Connectivity: Established a robust connector between Amplify and API Gateway.
Achievements/Outcomes:
•	Seamlessly developed a serverless web application empowering users to perform mathematical operations effortlessly.
•	Ensured data integrity and persistence by integrating DynamoDB with appropriate IAM permissions.
•	Established a secure and scalable architecture for efficient computation and API invocation.
Your Contributions/Key Learnings:
